# Simulated-Annealing-for-Combinatorial-Optimization-Traveling-Salesman-Problem
The traveling salesman problem is a well-known problem in the fields of discrete and combinatorial optimization. TSP can be defined as finding the shortest possible distance for a salesman starting from one point and reaching the same with a condition to visit each city or node only once. Numerous solutions to this problem have been put forth. In recent decades many heuristic techniques have gained popularity such as simulated annealing, ant colony optimization, tabu search, etc. In this notebook, we will focus on solving the TSP problem using simulated annealing and compare the results with two other algorithms, random search, and stochastic hill climber.
